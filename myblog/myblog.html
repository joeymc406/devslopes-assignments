			<h2>Early years with firearms</h2>
			<p>
				Growing up in <b>Montana</b> hunting is an extremely popular sport and pasttime that a great majority of
				families in our communities participate in. With it being so prevalent so is the use of firearms in the scope of
				hunting. I grew up learning hunting and firearm safety and used rifles most of my life for the purpose of
				hunting and also target shooting for fun. Growing up around them I have a great respect for them and understand
				them.

			<h2>Career involiving firearms</h2>
			<p>
				Years later at the age of 23 I started a career in law enforcement as a police officer in which I was required
				to carry a <b>Glock 22</b> for personal defense and defense of others in different situations. While I was
				required to carry a firearm I was also required to be trained with it and be proficient with it in a safe
				manner. During this time I began collecting them and enjoyed shooting them more for fun. I later purchased more
				<em>pistols</em> and <em>AR-15</em> in that I use now for fun and for protections of myself and my family.

			<h2>Constitutional right to bear arms</h2>
			<p>
				As a former Police Officer I understand the views on firearms and how people feel about them but I also
				understand that it is a fundamental right to have the capability, ability and means to protect yourself from
				others that wish to do you harm. The <em>Constitution</em> was created and within it the 2nd Amendement was
				created because our forefathers understood this necessity even with the limited technology of the time. You can
				read more on the 2nd Amendement <b> below</b>:
