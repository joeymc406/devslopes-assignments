					My choice for who I admire in my life is a bit of a controversial topic in todays political climate however I
					admire what he had been able to do and the accomplishments he had achieved during his presidency. Although
					there are always 2 sides to a topic i try to be as accurate as possible with what I say and believe. These
					beliefs are my own and should not reflect anything other than opinion not my character.

				<h3>Accomplishments as the 45th President of the United States.</h3>
				<p>
					Although some of his accomplishments have been shrouded in controversy many can be found on the
					<a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/trump-administration-accomplishments/">Archive.gov's website</a>
					but many will disagree or say it is false information. None the less here is a list of accomplishments as
					President that give me reason to admire.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The unemployment rate reached 3.5 percent, the lowest in a half-century.</li>
					<li>Achieved 40 months in a row with more job openings than job-hirings.</li>
					<li>More Americans reported being employed than ever before – nearly 160 million.</li>
					<li>Jobless claims hit a nearly 50-year low.</li>
					<li>
						Unemployment rates for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans, veterans,
						individuals with disabilities, and those without a high school diploma all reached record lows.
					</li>
					<li>Put in place policies to bring back supply chains from overseas.</li>
					<li>Signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act – the largest tax reform package in history</li>
					<li>Doubled the child tax credit.</li>
					<li>
						More than 6 million American workers received wage increases, bonuses, and increased benefits thanks to the
						tax cuts.
					</li>
					<li>
						Signed two executive orders to increase transparency in Federal agencies and protect Americans and their
						small businesses from administrative abuse.
					</li>
					<li>
						Cut red tape in the healthcare industry, providing Americans with more affordable healthcare and saving
						Americans nearly 10 percent on prescription drugs.
					</li>
					<li>For the first time in nearly 70 years, the United States has become a net energy exporter.</li>
					<li>The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world.</li>

					<p>
						While this list may seem short it is only a representation of my favorite accomplishments during his term.
						But like everyone else in the world he has his flaws with that being said i hope if you have read this far
						you will do the research and see for yourself.
